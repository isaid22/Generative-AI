## Agentic AI vs. Traditional LLM
Here are the differences between agentic AI and traditional LLM. 

### 1. Traditional LLM (e.g., GPT-4)
* What it does: A large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 is a statistical predictor‚Äîit generates text by predicting the next most likely tokens (words/subwords) based on its training data.

- Key Traits:

    - Passive: Responds to prompts but doesn‚Äôt take initiative or "act" beyond generating text.

    - Stateless: Each interaction is independent (unless explicitly designed otherwise, like in a chat session with memory).

    - Single-step: Answers one query at a time without planning or breaking down tasks.

    - No autonomy: Cannot execute actions (e.g., browse the web, run code, or book a flight) unless integrated with external tools (like ChatGPT plugins).

#### Example:
You ask GPT-4, *"Write a Python script to analyze this CSV file."* It generates the code but doesn‚Äôt run it, debug errors, or refine it unless you manually iterate.


### 2. Agentic AI
- **What it does**: An agent is an AI system that **plans, acts, and iterates** to achieve goals autonomously or semi-autonomously. It often combines an LLM with tools (APIs, code execution, search), memory, and decision-making loops.

- **Key Traits:**

    - **Proactive:** Can break down tasks into subtasks, set goals, and take steps to achieve them.

    - **Stateful:** Remembers past interactions and learns from feedback within a session.

    - **Multi-step:** Can chain actions (e.g., search the web ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí draft an email ‚Üí send it via API).

    - **Tool use:** Integrates with external systems (calculators, databases, browsers) to do things, not just talk about them.

    - **Self-correction:** Can critique and refine its own outputs (e.g., "This code failed; let me fix the error.").


#### Example:
You ask an agent, *"Find the latest research on LLM quantization techniques and summarize it for me."* The agent might:

1. Search the web for recent papers,

2. Extract key points,

3. Draft a summary,

4. Ask you if you‚Äôd like it formatted as a bullet list or a report.
